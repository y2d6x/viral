      {
        question: "What devices and platforms are supported?",
        answer: "Viral is available for iOS (iPhone and iPad) running iOS 14.0 or later, and Android devices running Android 8.0 or later. Download from the App Store or Google Play Store. The app is optimized for mobile-first creation.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a desktop or web version?",
        answer: "Viral is designed as a mobile-first experience because we believe creators need tools that work wherever they are. While you can access some features via our web portal for larger screens, the full power of Viral—including push notifications, quick creation, and on-the-go analytics—is best experienced on mobile.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much storage does the app need?",
        answer: "The Viral app is lightweight at around 150MB. Most content is stored securely in the cloud, so you won't fill up your phone. You can also enable offline mode to access saved posts and analytics without an internet connection.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use the app offline?",
        answer: "Yes! You can save drafts, view cached analytics, and plan content offline. When you reconnect, everything syncs automatically. Perfect for creating during flights or in areas with poor connectivity.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is the app free? How does pricing work?",
        answer: "Download Viral free from the App Store or Google Play. The app includes a free tier with basic features. Upgrade to Pro or Icon plans for advanced features, available as in-app purchases. Manage your subscription directly from your phone's settings. Cancel anytime with no penalties.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will the AI-generated posts sound authentic?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Viral's AI analyzes your posting history to learn your unique voice, style, and tone. Posts are generated to match your authentic voice—you'll edit and approve everything from your phone before posting. The AI augments your creativity, never replaces it.",
