1. Header:

A fixed (sticky) header with a dark background.

Logo (text): "Viral" (in a stylish, gold font).

Navigation Links: "Features," "Pricing," "Login."

Primary CTA Button: "Start Your 14-Day Free Trial" (with a solid gold background and dark text).

2. Above-the-Fold (Hero Section):

Headline: "Stop Guessing. Start Dominating. The Unfair AI Advantage for Creators."

Sub-headline: "Viral is the all-in-one AI platform that writes your posts, spots viral trends before they break, analyzes your competition, and connects you with brands—so you can focus on creating, not just managing."

Primary CTA: "Start Your 14-Day Free Trial" (large, gold button).

Hero Visual: Do NOT use a static image. Create a simulated, animated dashboard in a dark-themed card with gold highlights. This visual should feature:

A "Trend Radar" with a simple, looping line graph (use CSS/JS animations).

A "Sentiment" gauge (can be a simple animated dial or a static icon).

A "Dynamic Analytics" section with 3-4 bar charts that animate their height on loop (use CSS animations).

3. Trust Bar:

A simple, minimalist bar with the text "AS SEEN ON" followed by 4-5 grayscale placeholder logos (e.g., Forbes, TechCrunch, Wired, The Verge).

4. Social Proof (Testimonials):

A section with 2-3 testimonial cards.

Each card MUST follow this structure:

A high-quality, circular placeholder headshot.

Creator Handle: e.g., "@FashionForward"

Quantifiable Result: A bold, gold-text statistic, e.g., "+10,000 Followers in One Week"

Quote: Use the example quote: "Viral's Trend Radar is my secret weapon. I caught the 'retro-futurism' aesthetic wave a full week before my competitors..."

5. Feature Deep-Dive:

Organize features into three sections: "Intelligence Suite," "Content Automation Engine," and "Business Growth Hub."

Present this as a clean grid of feature cards.

Each card should have a simple gold-color icon, a Feature Title (e.g., "Advanced Analytics"), and the Benefit text (e.g., "Go beyond vanity metrics...").

Use all the features and benefits from Section 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of the blueprint.

6. Personal AI Strategist Highlight:

Create a dedicated section for the Interactive Q&A Agent.

Visually represent this with a mocked-up, clean chat interface.

Show a user question (e.g., "Why did my last post underperform?") and a data-rich AI response (e.g., "Your post at 3 PM...").

7. How It Works:

A simple, 3-step visual guide with icons:

Step 1: Connect Your Accounts ("Securely link your social media profiles in minutes...")

Step 2: Define Your Goals ("Tell Viral what you want to achieve...")

Step 3: Activate Your AI Co-Pilot ("You're in control. Approve AI-generated post ideas...")

8. Pricing Section:

Create a 3-tier pricing table based on "Table 1" from the blueprint.

Tiers: "Creator," "Pro," and "Icon."

Visually highlight the 'Pro' plan as "Most Popular" (e.g., with a gold border and a badge).

Include all features (AI Posts, Analytics, Competitor Tracking, etc.) and prices from the table.

The CTA for "Creator" and "Pro" should be "Start Free Trial" (gold button).

The CTA for "Icon" should be "Book a Demo" (a secondary-style button, e.g., gold border, transparent fill).

9. FAQ Section:

Create an accordion-style FAQ section.

Include all 5 questions and answers from Section 5.1 of the blueprint (e.g., "How is Viral different from ChatGPT...", "Is my account data secure...").

10. Competitive Analysis (The Viral Difference):

Add a section based on "Table 2" from the blueprint.

Title it: "The Viral Difference: One Platform to Replace Them All."

Create a responsive table that compares "Viral" to "Scheduling Platforms," "AI Writers," and "Analytics Platforms." Use SVG checkmarks (in gold) and dashes to show feature availability.

11. Final CTA Section:

A final, high-impact section.

Headline: "Stop Managing. Start Influencing."

Closing Copy: "The creator economy moves at the speed of light. 'Viral' is the intelligent engine that keeps you ahead of the curve..."

Final CTA Button: A large, unmissable "Start Your 14-Day Free Trial" (gold button).

12. Footer:

A comprehensive footer with links for "About Us," "Contact," "Careers," "Privacy Policy," and "Terms of Service."

Include simple placeholder icons for social media (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).
